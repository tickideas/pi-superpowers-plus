## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Fork metadata cleanup** — package/repository metadata, README install instructions, support links, contributing docs, roadmap links, and GitHub issue templates now point to `tickideas/pi-superpowers-plus` instead of the original fork source.
- **Worktree rototill (PRI-974, upstream PR #1121)** — `using-git-worktrees` and `finishing-a-development-branch` rewritten to detect-and-defer to native harness worktree tools when present, with a manual `git worktree` fallback. New Step 0 detection (`GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`) skips creation when already in a linked worktree (with submodule guard). Cleanup is now provenance-based — only superpowers-created worktrees under `.worktrees/`, `worktrees/`, or `~/.config/superpowers/worktrees/` are removed; harness-owned workspaces are left alone.
- **Detached HEAD menu** in `finishing-a-development-branch` — reduced 3-option menu (no merge) when working from an externally managed detached HEAD.
- **Continuous execution directive** in `subagent-driven-development` — fixes upstream's pause-every-3-tasks bug. Orchestrators now execute all tasks without check-in prompts unless BLOCKED.

### Changed

- **Workflow skill guidance refreshed** — updated `brainstorming`, `writing-plans`, `subagent-driven-development`, `executing-plans`, `systematic-debugging`, and `verification-before-completion` with a selective sync of newer upstream workflow guidance while preserving pi-specific behavior.
- **Upstream sync to `obra/superpowers` v5.1.0** (`f2cbfbe`) — mirrored worktree skill rewrites, SDD continuous-execution fix, root-cause-tracing path placeholder. Removed deprecated `> Related skills:` callouts and the `## Integration` section from skills that picked them up. Preserved fork-specific elements: `worker` / `reviewer` named-subagent dispatch, three-scenario TDD policy, `plan_tracker` integration, batch checkpoint model in `executing-plans`, `agents/code-reviewer.md` persona file, and `Step 1.5: Documentation and Learnings` in `finishing-a-development-branch`.
- **Subagent naming aligned with pi** — workflow docs and prompt templates now assume pi-style agent names:
  - `worker` for implementation work
  - `reviewer` for spec compliance review
  - `reviewer` for code quality review
  Prompt templates remain the specialization layer.

### Removed

- **`tdd-guard` extension** — TDD enforcement is now handled via runtime warnings in `workflow-monitor` and three-scenario TDD instructions embedded in agent profiles and skill text. Agent profiles no longer need `extensions: ../extensions/tdd-guard.ts` in their frontmatter.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-02-18

### Summary

Hardening and skill boundary enforcement. Security fixes, resilient subagent lifecycle, and fixes for three behavioral gaps where the agent ignores skill boundaries.

### Security

- **Environment variable filtering** — subagent spawn now uses an allowlist instead of `{ ...process.env }`. Only safe vars (PATH, HOME, SHELL, NODE_*, PI_*, etc.) are forwarded. Secrets like API keys, database URLs, and cloud credentials are no longer leaked to subagent processes.
- **`PI_SUBAGENT_ENV_PASSTHROUGH`** — escape hatch for users who need to forward specific vars (comma-separated names).
- **CWD validation** — subagent spawn now validates the working directory exists before spawning, returning a clear error instead of a cryptic ENOENT.

### Added

- **Configurable subagent timeout** (`PI_SUBAGENT_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 10 min) — absolute timeout that kills subagents regardless of activity. Agent definitions can override via `timeout` field.
- **Cancellation propagation** — active subagent processes are tracked and killed (SIGTERM → SIGKILL) when the parent session exits.
- **Concurrent subagent cap** (`PI_SUBAGENT_CONCURRENCY`, default 6) — semaphore-based limit on parallel subagent spawns. When the cap is hit, new invocations queue until a slot opens.

### Fixed

- **SDD orchestrator codes on subagent failure** — Promoted subagent failure handling from buried bullet points to a gated section with hard rules. Explicit: the orchestrator does NOT write code, only dispatches subagents. 2 failed attempts = stop and escalate to user.
- **Review subagents apply fixes** — Added explicit read-only `## Boundaries` sections to `code-reviewer.md` and `spec-reviewer-prompt.md`. Reviewers produce written reports — they never touch code.
- **SDD auto-finishes without asking** — Added user checkpoint after all tasks complete. Orchestrator must summarize results and wait for user confirmation before dispatching final review or starting the finishing skill.
- Silent catch blocks in workflow-monitor now log warnings via `log.warn` instead of silently swallowing failures (state file read/write errors).

### Changed

- **Package version** bumped to `0.3.0`.

## [0.2.0-alpha.1] — 2026-02-13

### Summary

First-class subagent support. Skills now dispatch implementation and review work via a bundled `subagent` tool instead of shell commands. Four default agent definitions ship with the package. The workflow monitor and TDD enforcement both received important correctness fixes.

### Added

- **Subagent extension** (`extensions/subagent/`) — vendored from pi's example extension. Registers a `subagent` tool that spawns isolated pi subprocesses for implementation and review tasks. Supports single-agent and parallel (multi-task) modes.
- **Agent definitions** (`agents/`) — four bundled agent profiles:
  - `implementer` — strict TDD implementation with the tdd-guard extension
  - `worker` — general-purpose task execution
  - `code-reviewer` — production readiness review (read-only)
  - `spec-reviewer` — plan/spec compliance verification (read-only)
- **Agent frontmatter `extensions` field** — agent `.md` files can declare extensions (e.g. `extensions: ../extensions/tdd-guard.ts`), which are resolved and passed as `--extension` flags to the subprocess.
- **TDD guard extension** (`extensions/tdd-guard.ts`) — lightweight TDD enforcement designed for subagents. Blocks production file writes until a passing test run is observed. Tracks violations via `PI_TDD_GUARD_VIOLATIONS_FILE` env var. Exits after 3 consecutive blocked writes.
- **Structured subagent results** — single-agent mode returns `filesChanged`, `testsRan`, `tddViolations`, `agent`, `task`, and `status` fields in tool result details.
- **Shared test helpers** (`tests/extension/workflow-monitor/test-helpers.ts`) — `createFakePi()`, `getSingleHandler()`, `getHandlers()` extracted and shared across all workflow-monitor test files.
- **`parseSkillName()` utility** (`extensions/workflow-monitor/workflow-tracker.ts`) — centralized `/skill:name` and `<skill name="...">` extraction, replacing duplicated regexes.

### Fixed

- **Input event text field** — Workflow monitor now reads `event.text` (primary) with fallback to `event.input` for skill detection in user input. Previously only checked `event.input`, missing skills delivered via the `text` field.
- **Completion gate phase scoping** — Interactive commit/push/PR prompts now only fire during execute+ phases. Previously they could fire during brainstorm/plan, interrupting early-phase work (e.g. committing a design doc).
- **docs/plans allowlist path traversal** — The brainstorm/plan write allowlist now resolves paths against `process.cwd()` and requires the resolved path to be under `${cwd}/docs/plans/`. Previously, an absolute path like `/tmp/evil/docs/plans/attack.ts` would pass the substring check.
- **TDD guard pass/fail semantics** — The tdd-guard extension now requires a *passing* test result (exit code 0) to unlock production writes. Previously, any test command execution — including failures — would unlock writes.

### Changed

- **Skills updated for subagent dispatch** — `subagent-driven-development`, `dispatching-parallel-agents`, and `requesting-code-review` skills now show `subagent()` tool call examples instead of `pi -p` shell commands.
- **Package version** bumped to `0.2.0-alpha.1`.
- **`package.json` `files`** now includes `agents/` directory.
- **`package.json` `pi.extensions`** now includes `extensions/subagent/index.ts`.

### Internal

- Deduplicated ~180 lines of test helper boilerplate across 6 workflow-monitor test files.
- Added 8 new test files (67 new tests) covering subagent discovery, frontmatter extensions, structured results, tdd-guard behavior, completion gate phasing, path traversal, and input event handling.
- Total test count: **29 files, 251 tests**.
